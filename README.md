# CS1101S Studio Slides

CS1101S - Programming Methodology is the introductory programming course taught at School of Computing, National University of Singapore. 
The course is largely structured around the SICP JS textbook, which is an adaptation of the original SICP textbook for JavaScript.

This repository contains most of the slides and miscellaneous documents that I use for my studios.

### Credits
Slides are based off [David's slides](https://github.com/david-eom/CS1101S-TA), with some content adjustments.
